Please implement a complete color palette overhaul for my theme with these requirements:

**Color Inspiration:** [Attach image/specify colors OR describe aesthetic like "warm autumn", "cool ocean", "earthy forest", etc.]

**Aesthetic Goal:** [Specify mood - e.g., "tranquil and calming", "energetic and modern", "professional and trustworthy"]

**Color Theory:** [Choose one - "analogous colors", "complementary colors", "monochromatic", "triadic"]

**Grayscale:** when updating the theme colors they have a grayscale value associated with them. If you can't think of something try to match the grayscale value to the new color.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Update ALL colors in the theme (primary, accents, backgrounds, text)
- **CRITICAL: Ensure every single color is completely unique** - no duplicates allowed
- **NO PURE WHITE ALLOWED** - use off-whites, creams, or very light tints instead
- Ensure ADA/WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- Use off-whites/pure whites/cream tones for light backgrounds
- Test accessibility with Playwright browser tools
- Maintain consistent color relationships across all elements

**Verification Steps (MUST DO):**
1. Check that all 10 colors have different RGB values
2. Verify no pure white (#FFFFFF or RGB(255,255,255)) is used
3. Test contrast ratios for all text/background combinations
4. Verify no two colors are identical or too similar

**Don't preserve:** Any existing colors - make everything fresh and new

**Do preserve:** The overall professional appearance and readability

Please show me the contrast ratios and test the final result for accessibility compliance AND uniqueness verification.
